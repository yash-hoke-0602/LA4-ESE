        <article class="textstyle1">In mid-November, the gaming world was brought to its knees when Sony Interactive Entertainment released the PlayStation 5. Within minutes, it sold out at retailers online everywhere.

            When the PS5 went on sale Nov. 12, Sony opted to offer it online only the first day due to COVID-19 exposure risks at retail stores. As a result of sales being online, retail bots were able to buy up much of the merchandise from Walmart and other retailers who offered it in November, as described by the BBC, and it's been increasingly difficult for individuals to buy a PS5 for themselves or as a gift for the holidays. 
            
            Demand is high, in part, because this is essentially the first new PlayStation since the PS4 came out seven years ago. There are two versions of the PS5. There is a $400 digital-only mode, the Digital Edition, and a $500 console version, the PS5 Disc edition. The only difference between the two is that the console edition includes an Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive to allow for PS5 Blu-ray disc games, PS4 Blu-ray disc games, video from 4K Ultra HD Blu-rays, standard Blu-rays and DVDs.
